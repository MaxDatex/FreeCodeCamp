        <ul>
        <li>As a young man the Duke came to the opinion that the future lay in aviation. It became his passion, and in <strong>1929</strong>, the Duke earned his pilot's licence. He was the first of the royal family to cross the Atlantic Ocean by air. Before his flying days, he entered the Royal Navy, and was trained in intelligence work while stationed at Rosyth.</li>

          <li>In <strong>March 1937</strong>, he was granted a commission in the Royal Air Force as a group captain. He was also made the Honorary Air Commodore of No. 500 (County of Kent) Squadron Auxiliary Air Force in August 1938. He was promoted to air vice-marshal in <strong>June 1939</strong>, along with promotions to flag and general officer rank in the other two services.</li>

          <li>In <strong>1939</strong> he returned to active service as a rear admiral in the Royal Navy, but in <strong>April 1940</strong>, transferred to the Royal Air Force. He temporarily relinquished his rank as an air officer to assume the post of staff officer at RAF Training Command in the rank of group captain, so that he would not be senior to more experienced officers. On <strong>28 July 1941</strong>, he assumed the rank of air commodore in the Welfare Section of the RAF Inspector General's Staff. In this role, he went on official visits to RAF bases to help boost wartime morale.</li>
